# Microloans-data

This repository contains a jupyter notebook (‘Charts.ipynb’) containing the code to build most of the charts given in the article ‘Basic recommender system of microfinance institutions’. The .py files contain all the necessary functions for this purpose. To get started, you need to download all the datasets and place them in the ‘Datasets’ folder.
